        <h3  id="q4">Which of the following scoping type does JavaScript use?</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Sequential</li>

          <p>Answer: C</p>

        <h3  id="q5">Which of the following is NOT an error in JavaScript?</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Missing of Bracket</li>

        <section id="a5">
          <p>Answer: B</p>
          <p>In JavaScript, division by zero does not result in an error; it just returns infinity or negative infinity. However, because zero divided by zero has no well-defined value, the result of this operation is the unusual not-a-number value, which is written as NaN.</p>
